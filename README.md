# Space Beatz Game


###This game is a joint development project between three developers. It was created as their final project for Java II. The program is written in Java and uses many aspects of the JavaFX API. The game itself is procedural and declarative in nature taking advantage of FXML. This unique game uses audio visualization techniques that create a dynamic and customized game play experience.
